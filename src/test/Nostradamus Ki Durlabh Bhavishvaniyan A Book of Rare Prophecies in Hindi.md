Nostradamus was born in 1503 and died in 1566. He was a physician, astrologer and author who wrote a collection of 942 poetic quatrains called Les Propheties. These quatrains are said to foretell future events, such as wars, disasters, plagues, revolutions and the end of the world. Nostradamus used a method of cryptic symbolism and anagrams to hide his prophecies from the authorities who could persecute him for heresy.
 
Nostradamus Ki Durlabh Bhavishvaniyan is a book that presents some of the rare and obscure prophecies of Nostradamus in Hindi. The book covers topics such as the rise and fall of empires, the advent of antichrists, the role of India in world affairs, the fate of religions, the secrets of nature and the mysteries of time. The book also interprets some of the prophecies that are relevant to the current times, such as the coronavirus pandemic, the climate change, the conflicts in the Middle East and the emergence of new technologies.
 
The book is a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in Nostradamus and his predictions. The book also provides a glimpse into the mind and vision of one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in history. The book is a must-have for anyone who wants to know what Nostradamus had to say about the past, present and future of humanity.
  
Not only that, Nostradamus also predicted some calamities for 2021 that could threaten the existence of humanity. According to his prophecies, 2021 will bring a long trail of sparks and hit the Earth's surface in the form of solar storms and a great asteroid made of fire. This asteroid will extremely damage the Earth and cause earthquakes and other natural disasters. Nostradamus wrote: "In the sky, one see fire and a long trail of sparks."
 
Another prediction that Nostradamus made for 2021 is the death of a great leader that will spark World War 3. He wrote: "In the city of God, there will be a great thunder. Two brothers are torn apart by chaos while the fortress endures. The great leader will succumb. The third big war will begin when the big city is burning." Some experts believe that this could refer to a conflict between two allied countries or a nuclear attack on a major city.
 
Nostradamus also warned of a plague that will afflict the world in 2021. He wrote: "Fathers and mothers dead of infinite sorrows, Women in mourning, the pestilent sheâmonster: The Great One to be no more, all the world to end." Some people think that this could be related to the coronavirus pandemic that started in 2020 and has claimed millions of lives. Others think that this could be a new virus or a biological weapon that will be unleashed by a rogue nation or a terrorist group.
 
While these predictions may sound terrifying and gloomy, Nostradamus also gave some hope for 2021. He wrote: "The Great Mover renews the ages." This could mean that after the disasters and wars, humanity will enter a new era of peace and harmony. He also wrote: "Rain, blood, milk." This could mean that there will be abundant food and water for the survivors. He also wrote: "The heavens fire seen." This could mean that there will be a divine intervention or a sign from God that will guide humanity to a better future.
